        <p class="intro-left">I am a recent graduate from Brock University. My experience to date demonstrates strong work ethic, exceptional communication and time management skills, as well as high adaptability. Other strengths I have developed to a high degree over the years, include being responsible, presentable and a personable individual with a mature attitude.
        <br><br><br>My experiences as a Residence Don combined with my sports and acting background, have allowed me to fulfil all my previous responsibilities, and engage with prospective students in an effective and positive manner. During my studies, I have learned the value of collaboration and further improved my leadership skills. Throughout my academic life, I have always strived to be an outstanding ambassador and role model to other students, which required excellent communication, patience and understanding.
